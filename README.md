# circles-org

Usually, we open an issue when we have something we need to do, but not all of our tasks are attached to any specific codebase, and not all of them involve writing code at all!

Look under 'issues' for some non-code tasks that you can pick up to help the development of the circles org.  Please ask questions, and if you start working on something, let us know and assign it to yourself :)

whatever you want!
